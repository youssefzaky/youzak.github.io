(Coming soon!) In this post we will understand and implement the components of the modern object detection and instance segmentation model Mask-RCNN. Object detectors involve many parts and
it can be difficult to follow the code in the open implementations available. Here we will give a clear layout of the implementation of such a model. This post is divided into two parts. In this first one, we will construct the Mask-RCNN network and several of it's components. This will allow us to perform inference using the pretrained weights available from Facebook's Detectron (link), which will help us understand how that object-detection framework works. In the  second part of the post, we will actually train the network ourselves and understand the steps involved in that process.
